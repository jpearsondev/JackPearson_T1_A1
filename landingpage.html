     <div class="welcome"><strong>Welcome to Jack Pearson's Portfolio</strong> </div>
     <div class="introduction"><strong>This website will provide you with insight into my skills, experience, interests and generally just an overview of me. Thank you for stopping by and by all means please get in contact with me via LinkedIn, Email or take a look at my GitHub account for all my past and current projects.</strong></div>

    <h1>Welcome and thank you for your interest in my work.</h1>

        <h2> A quick overview of me.</h2>

        <p>My name is Jack pearson and I am a student at the Australian Technology Institute completing a diploma of IT through their web development boot camp. I am very new to coding and technology in general however have always felt that I am a fast and dedicated learner with a keen interest on creativity and building relationships with fellow students and alumni. My previous experience encompasses Sales, Customer Service, Superannuation, Financial Planning, Banking and Home Lending. My most recent role before starting my web development journey was working as a Lending Specialist for Heritage Bank in Brisbane. This taught me invaluable skills around finance and how money works and gave me a great base skill set of developing relationships with clients and more importantly, "out of the box" thinking to ensure that I could assist as many customers with there home loans as I could. 
        </p>

        <p>Along with my current study I have a few other qualifications gained through out the years. Most notable (and most used) are a Diploam of Financial Planning and a Certificate IV in Banking Services. I also have been accrediated by ASFA (Association of Suaperannuation Funds of Australia) and have completed many RG certificates such as the RG 146 and RG 206 as well as being a Tier 2 Lender and Advisor in both credit products and Superannuation.</p>

        <p>I am currently a humble bartender at a local pub in my hometown of Warwick, QLD and have been there for 3 months. While to some this may look as a step back in my career I have found it extremly rewarding in leanring a new skill in hosptiality to add to my resume and work on my soft skills such as connecting with people while still keeping a professional outlook. In any case it is a great oppurtunity to have experience in another field to ensure that I will not be without work for very long.</p>

        <p>I have a wide variety of interest that keeps me busy when I am not working or studying. One of them, and one that I think is vital to have success in web development, is coding. This is the whole reason I decided to uproot my life in Brisbane and undertake further study. I love everything about property and investing and am always working towards an early retirement age (or soft retirement!). I am an avid golfer and will take any oppurtunity to get out onto the course and soak in the sun and get away from all the life noise. I love cars and hope to one day have my own garage fully set up to build and create any vehicle I wish (first on the list is a fully self contained Landcruiser Troop Carrier for trekking across Australia). Finally a more recent love is going to the gym and working up a sweat. There is nothing better than feeling accomplisdhed by hitting a new PB in the gym!</p>

        <p>Once again, thank you for taking the time to visit my website and I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
